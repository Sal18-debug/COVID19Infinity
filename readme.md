Inspiration behind Project/What led to this project?

The general inspiration for this project is that during these months of the pandemic, I noticed that people looked at different sources of information to learn about safe practices and behavior. I began to think of solutions to this issue: people having to remember and have to go to different websites and different sources of information for current news and tested solutions for the pandemic. That is how my teammates and I help come with the idea of COVID-19 Infinity. Also, the recent wildfires in California also contributed to this idea.

Short Description

COVID-19 Infinity is a repository of information designed to help people to understand what new high tech solutions are being tested and carried out in different regions around the world. 

How does you project give a positive impact on society? Benefits?

Whatâ€™s next after the project?
After completing and launching this project, we are hopeful to maintain updates on the website to serve the users who rely on the website. During this pandemic, news items and new developments can easily come and go, and so it would be best to update the website. Updating the website with more current and new news, technological solutions, and more will be essential in order to keep helping people during this pandemic.

Steps on how Covid Statistics API Was Done
==========================================
- All the code is in the apis.js file
- In the solutions.html file, the apis.js file is loaded as a script
- On solutions.html page load, the function in the apis.js file is called. That function does a AJAX GET request (using JQuery which is also included as a script in the solutions.html page)
- The returned data is parsed to a JSON object
- Valus from that object is then assigned to the specific labels
